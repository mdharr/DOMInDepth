Arrays and Strings
Arrays: The most basic and commonly used data structure, useful for storing a collection of elements in a specific order and accessible by indices.
Strings: Often treated similarly to arrays but specifically for textual data. Questions might involve string manipulation, pattern matching, or text processing.

Linked Lists
Singly Linked Lists: Composed of nodes that each hold a reference to the next node in the list, allowing for efficient insertion and removal.
Doubly Linked Lists: Similar to singly linked lists but with nodes that also reference the previous node, facilitating backward traversal.

Stacks and Queues
Stacks: Follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, useful for scenarios like function call stacks, undo mechanisms, and parsing.
Queues: Adhere to the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, used in task scheduling, buffering, and breadth-first traversal of trees or graphs.

Trees
Binary Trees: Every node has at most two children. Questions might involve traversal, searching, or modification.
Binary Search Trees (BST): A special kind of binary tree that keeps elements in a sorted order, allowing for efficient searching.
Balanced Trees: Variants like AVL trees or Red-Black trees maintain a balanced height to ensure operation efficiencies.

Graphs
Directed and Undirected Graphs: Used to represent relationships and connections, common in problems involving routing, social networks, and dependency analysis.
Trees as a subset of graphs: Special case with no cycles, leading to hierarchical structures.

Hash Tables
Hash Maps or Dictionaries: Store key-value pairs with efficient lookup, addition, and deletion. Commonly used for caching, unique item tracking, and fast data retrieval.

Heaps
Binary Heap (Min-Heap and Max-Heap): Often used in priority queues and for efficient sorting algorithms.

Advanced Structures
Depending on the role's complexity, you might also encounter:
Tries: Used for efficient retrieval of keys in a set, common in autocomplete and spell-check systems.
Suffix Trees/Arrays: For substring search, pattern matching in strings.
Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees): For range queries and updates in array-like structures, often encountered in more algorithm-intensive roles.

In the Interview
You may be asked to:

Implement these data structures from scratch.
Solve problems using built-in data structures in your language of choice.
Optimize existing code by choosing the right data structure for the task.
